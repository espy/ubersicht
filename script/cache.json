This makes offline-first storage less useful, since i can't be offline and download hoodie.js.\r\n\r\nAlthough one could manually download the script from api server to its assets folder it is very difficult to integrate hoodie.js in an independent build process this way.\r\n\r\nSo i suggest either to provide a static precompiled hoodie.js and plugins via bower.js or, to keep consistent with `hoodie-cli` way to install things: let's just add a new command to hoodie-cli eg. `hoodie compile-js [DEST]` so we can get the dynamic version of `hoodie.js` file right from the command line without running the server.\r\n\r\n",

Currently Hoodie asks for an admin pass on first start. There is an option to pass the `HOODIE_ADMIN_PASS` environment variable to avoid that, but it is unclear yet how this would work with init.d/runit.\r\n\r\nHere are a few random notes:\r\n\r\n`hoodie start`:\r\n - runs a hoodie instance\r\n - interactively asks for setup if none exists\r\n\r\ninit.d/runit etc scripts:\r\n - runs `hoodie start` as a system user, e.g.`hoodie` redirects stdout/err into /var/log/hoodie.log / .err\r\n\r\nsetup:\r\n - set up system user, e.g. `hoodie`\r\n - install hoodie app as hoodie (or adjust all perms accordingly)\r\n - make sure hoodie can write to /var/log & /var/run\r\n\r\n\r\nopen questions:\r\n  - how to configure a hoodie installation (admin pass, port(s)) without manual intervention?\r\n\t  - how does HOODIE_ADMIN_PASS gets passed through init.d/runit etc?\r\n  - how to handle multiple hoodie instances on a single machine?\r\n\t - one answer is using docker, but that adds complexity to the setup\r\n\t - another would be individual and customised init.d/runit etc scripts\r\n\r\n\r\nDocker:\r\n See https://github.com/mozilla-appmaker/haas/blob/master/PLAN.md\r\n",

Through a hoodie task a game app front end adds points to players score and the backend picks up the task to make an update and and evaluate this addition to determine if the points result in a a level up.  The backend can trigger a successful task completion like so:\r\n\r\n    hoodie.task.success( db, doc, /*opt*/callback )\r\n\r\nwhich currently updates the task doc with:\r\n\r\n    '$processedAt': moment().format(),\r\n    '_deleted': true\r\n\r\nBut other than generating another doc for the front end to listen for, there's seems to be no immediate way to close the loop with additional data to let the front end know that the points resulted in a level change.  Therefore, I propose:\r\n\r\n    hoodie.task.success( db, doc, doneData, /*opt*/callback )\r\n\r\nWhere 'doneData' is any additional data to deliver back to the front end.\r\n\r\nIt appears I may be able to work around this by performing a manual update that mimic the success process (along with the add-on of my own cargo data), but adding something like this would be ideal.\r\n\r\nAlso, there dose not appear to be any documentation on the use of this method so I had to look for it in the source.
